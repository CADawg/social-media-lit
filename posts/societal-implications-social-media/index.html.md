# The Societal Implications of Social Media

Social media has been quickly shaping the world that we live in today. From how people communicate with each other from day to day, to how businesses connect with customers. YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat are all considered the 5 main media sites all access millions of millions of times each month. Something this big has this just has to have implications.

One of which is visibility: Social Media has made it so much easier to communicate with others all around the globe, making it much harder to hide things from one another. It is quicker for different countries to get their news out, that news can be altered or falsified by the time it works its way down to social media.

### Cyberbullying And It's Ascension

In the wake of a society that communicates mainly on computers and technology, It was almost inevitable that some form of bullying or offensive material would surface. Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that takes place online, Usually on social media sites and apps such as Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook. This has taken the somewhat comical playground bully to an online environment where arguable they can inflict much more damage. This was recognised in 1997 when the Protection From Harassment Act was passed making online bullying, harassment and offensive material illegal. A similar law covers our next topic.

### Paedophilia and Sexual Predators

The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and the Sexual Offenses Act 2003 both work sort of intertwined against sexual predators online. If a person of over 18 is harassing or speaking to child online which would be considered of sexual relation to a reasonable person, they are breaking the law. Similarly to bullying, sexual predators have taken to the internet to commit there crimes. Parents used to be worried about strangers offering to their kids home from school or offering them sweet from the back of a white Ford Transit, They must now teach their kids the dangers of the internet.

### Physical Meetings

Most kids now prefer to play Minecraft or CS:GO on their Â£1500 computers instead of going out to play football or literally anything else.  This is an example of how easy its become to just stay inside and speak to your mates through FaceTime, Skype or TeamSpeak.
