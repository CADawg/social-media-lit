# The Dangers of Social Media to You & Friends

Social media has a lot of positives on society, however as with everything there's a twist. Social media also can be very dangerous if used with malicious intent.

## Privacy

*   A lot of social media sites hold personal information about users
*   If you haven't set up the privacy settings this information can be seen by anyone
*   This information could be address, date of birth, full name, age, etc.

## Account Security

It is possible for a social media account to be hacked, if this is the case then the hacker can make changes to the account and even make posts or send messages. To prevent your account being hacked you can have a more secure password, try not to use information others may know such as the name of a pet.

They can also access info that may be on a high privacy setting, like "Only Me", as they would be you and you can see everything stored about you. If you don't want it to be hacked, then don't store it on a social media website. Also, sometimes they leak data through developer applications, even if your privacy is something like 'Friends', as they can request permissions to see data about your friends.

## People spread misinformation

It is a lot easier to spread misinformation and to get it to stick online, and it is often harder to clean up. Once it is on the internet, it is hard to get it back off. They can even pay for likes and interaction to make it appear higher up on others feeds, meaning that it could convince more people, this is dangerous and could ruin someone's life/reputation online and may cause them serious harm. Also, it is almost never dealt with so it has less consequences, so it seems.

These are just a few reasons that social media can be dangerous to people and businesses, but of course, there are more to consider.
