Social media is forever growing, with new developments all the time, the amount of change within even a single year is remarkable.

&nbsp;

## Current Developments:

### Live Video:

Live streaming is available on multiple platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube and Twitch. These are cheap, and often free from the aforementioned services. Also, it is relatively accessible and allows for more personal engagement with the viewers. As Streaming has a wide variety of uses, it can be used for advertisements to Q&A's, gaming and the list goes on. It truly is safe to say there is some form of a live video content for everyone's enjoyment.

### Filters:

Available on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram. These filters are additions added to a photo through software that checks where the face is. Using this, it then adds/removes things from/to the photo, allowing people to get creative. Adding filters to pictures, especially selfies, is very popular at the moment. Now, even brands are getting in on this, by creating sponsored filters for these platforms. These are displayed on the platform for a certain amount of time for a fee, much like regular advertising.

### 360-degree video:

The ability to now move your device around to change your view of a video shot in 360 degrees is slowly becoming popular more and more in social media, this could be due to:

*   Increased internet bandwidth, so larger amounts of data are transferred per second, so a whole 360 degrees video is able to be streamed smoothly on a decent internet connection.
*   This is also probably due to the fact that 360-capable cameras are gradually becoming cheaper, and thus, more mainstream.
*   This could also be due to Increased graphics capabilities of modern computers, allowing for smooth playback on devices.
*   Virtual reality, which allows a viewer to see in 360 degrees just by looking around, and with a phone, you can get your hands on a basic VR headset relatively cheaply.

### Chatbots

A computer program made to conduct a conversation and follow a process. They provide a useful response to the client, within a reasonable time. These mimic human interaction. They are cheaper than a human, meaning you can run a lot of them to help a lot of customers at once, of course, they can only figure out from what they know, but as AI and other technologies evolve, chatbots are becoming smarter by the second.
