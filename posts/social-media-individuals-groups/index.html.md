# Uses for Social Media to Individuals and Groups

The uses for social media are immense. Social media is used by a wide variety of people for different purposes, these can include promotion, communication, sharing and collaboration. We may think of social media as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and similar websites, but really, social media can be a lot broader than that.

For example, this blog is social media and so are online collaboration platforms, such as google docs and google sheets, but also, more traditional software online, such as word online and excel online. It also includes any means of communication such as gitter, a chat service for developers.

## For Individuals:

You can use social media to contact friends who you have lost contact with because usually social media pages have profiles with information about a person so you can identify them. This allows people to reconnect when they usually couldn't. Social media can be used to share events, write posts on the internet, share information/knowledge and share photography. It allows people to connect in new ways. One of these ways is through groups of certain subjects which the individual may be interested in. Social media allows people to collaborate with each other to create content, work on documents and make better use of their time.

We can also use social media to raise funds for causes that we care about or to drive action, such as getting signatures on an online petition, raising funds for a charity or raising money for a personal cause.

Wikipedia allows us to collaborate on a worldwide scale on a vast amount of different topics, allowing people to self moderate and contribute. [Real people](https://www.google.com/?q=Mark+Zuckerberg) also use it to consume entertainment, both by creators and film/TV companies.

## For Groups:

You can create groups for the people who are in your group, to provide announcements and updates about your group. This can be useful to keep in touch. You can also use it to collaborate or choose when to hold events. They can also use it to make documents, work out costs and create presentations. They can also use it to raise funds for events which will happen.

Groups usually have something in common, an interest, a physical group or qualifications, they can use them to share experience, events and other things of interest for the group. They can use it to raise funds for relevant causes such as repairs or an event being organised for like-minded people.
