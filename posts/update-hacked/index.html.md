Howdy Y'all, Stephen H here! Just a quick update to tell you whats been happening to our blog recently and why you might be confused on some of the content of the posts.

&nbsp;

Recently myself and the admin of the lit media bloggers had a little bit of a dispute over whether our blog had been hacked. (It had kind of been hacked but nothing big had happened to it) I was very angry that he didn't take my detective skills of tracking the IP address and finding where this hacker lived appropriately and continued to argue with me that we had not been hacked.

&nbsp;

Over the past week the admin and I had argued during all of our meetings and Skype calls with each other meaning I was out for revenge.

&nbsp;

I decided it would be a good idea to seek for revenge and pretend to be that hacker from before but only this time post malicious posts, 'exposing' the admin. The posts contained things about his personal details which should not have been shared which I now regret doing. On top of all this a company was actually searching his name as he went for an interview. This was at a huge corporation and they could have found my, 'exposed' posts jeopardising his chance of getting in.

&nbsp;

I would just like to apologise to the admin and to you guys for being petty and ruining the content of our blog for a few short hours.

All the best to Conor and fingers crossed he gets in!

In other news I'm glad to see we've made it to YouTube!

That's all from now, love Stephen H.
