# How you can protect your privacy online

### 1. Don't fill in social media profiles
Do not fill in your profile more than you need to, because the more you share online, the more likely it is for someone to get their hands on it, so just don't help them out.

Keep your social media profile stripped, don't include anything like birth date, email address or phone number, because the people who need them should already have them. If you care about your privacy, just don't do it!

### 2. Be picky about who you share your SSN or NI with
Think carefully before giving out this information, unless you are giving it to a trusted party who needs this for operation, such as banks, credit bueros or companies, but make sure that they are legitimate too. Due to the way these numbers are calculated, it is very easy to determine the rest, if they have the last four digits with enough time and computing power and if they know your birth place.

### 3. Lock Down Hardware
Always make sure that your PC requires a password on wake, in case you take it out and it is stolen or you lose it. With phones, you shouls also use a passcode. Not only this but you should also have some software which can locate, lock and wipe your device so that strangers can't get access to the immense amount of personal data stored within it.

Make sure that you have anti-malware apps so as to prevent criminals from stealing your data using malware and virusses.

### 4. Turn on Incognito
If you don't want anyone who looks at your PC to be able to snoop through your history, use this mode so that none is left behind. Obviously, this doesn't hide you from sites though and for that you might want to look into getting a VPN such as [PIA](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) to stop sites from tracking your location and activity across the web. These sites can follow you around sites using their widgets, such as follow or like buttons, and google can follow you on 70% of sites, this is because of AdSense and Google Analytics.

### 5. Use A Password Manager

Most people know not to use the same password for more than one website, yet we all still do it. This is where a good password manager comes in, as it will allow you to store all your secure passwords, while only needing to remember the master password. It'll do all the form filling for you too, Which is kinda awesome!
