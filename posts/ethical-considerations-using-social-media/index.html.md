Hey there welcome back to another blog post all about social media. This one is all about the ever changing ethical argument of using networks. Despite the importance in social media, and its development growth in human's communication, there are many ethical issues in social networking that should be taken into deep caution and consideration. In this brand new post, we will discuss several ethical issues in social networking:

### Free speech

Freedom of speech is a valid human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights where everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Although free speech is always seen as unobtrusive to many and supported in democratic ideology, in the wrong hands the right can be twisted and manipulated to create and stir up controversy or make racist and politically offensive remark and comments. Often lines become blurred between hatred and inappropriateness and the excuse of 'free speech' this issue is some prominent online because many will say things they would never in the real world and so much of it can be hard to control.

### Privacy

The internet contains a whole heap of data and it is always a topic of debate and concern for privacy issues in social networking sites. Although term and conditions were always made to be seen and agreed during a sign up process, most of the time we click agree without even looking twice possibly signing away our soul to the devil (or just all our personal details).                                                                If you haven't been living under a rock recently you will be aware of the latest online social networking scandal. Many people feel (and rightly so) that their personal information are being spread far more wider than they intended it to be. This year, there are news reports on Facebook users are committing 'Virtual Identity Suicide' in deleting their accounts due to privacy concerns and fear of internet addiction.

###  Identity Theft

Identity theft is another scary example of ethical issues in social networking. It is a form of technique used by criminals to pretend to be someone you are not with intention to pursue or commit for crime. The victim will be held to be responsible for the consequences of fraud or action done the impersonators. Identity theft on the Internet can happen by either creating a fake account or stealing and hacking the password of the victim.
