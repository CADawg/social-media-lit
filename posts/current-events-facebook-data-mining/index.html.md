# Current Events: Facebook Data Mining


## Facebook Data Mining

A firm, known as Cambridge Analytica has been misusing around 50 Million Facebook users' private information. This firm does political consultancy. They have been consultants to Donald Trump in the 2016 election.

They are not the only ones doing this, though, many other apps have syphoned facebook users' data too. These include FarmVille, Tinder and Political Consultants from Obama's 2012 presidential campaign. These companies have syphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing a good understanding of the users' relationships and preferences.

### How did they do this?

![Data Mining is carried out through various other methods too!](android-2029541_640-257x300.png)Cambridge Analytica, like some other services that access Facebook user data, broke Facebooks rules by pretending it was going to use the data for _academic_ purposes. Experts familiar with Facebook say the bigger problem is the rules for accessing Facebook user data are too relaxed. This gets even worse if you think of all the data that they could have mined out of 50 Million Facebook accounts, all the relationships, posts, and, well... everything!

Sign in through FB came around in 2007 when Mark Zuckerberg invited developers to build their apps off of Facebook's data, giving them easy access to the friends, likes and connections of any Facebook user, and once they had them on board, they could access all this data extremely easily and simply, and, perhaps, even scarier is that they could also access **behaviour** and **location** data of a user!

The app they used was This Is Your Digital Life", offering personality predictions. Then used to harvest this data from users.

### Why would they do this?

The information aforementioned is of very high value to marketers and political campaigners as they can really target a user. So as to try and heavily persuade them to buy this or do that or vote for this that and the other. This is also used for fundraisers. As well as all this, the developers could keep the data forever, **NO RESTRICTIONS WHATSOEVER!**

### What is happening now?

Facebook has finally opened their eyes and in 2015 decided to change its policy, but as we can clearly tell because this post exists, that hasn't worked out all too great!

Now, what is allowed by FB and how it told users is under a fresh light due to these events. They have said that they will review what Cambridge Analytica did. Also, they will check whether they have complied with Facebook's demands.

Facebook did nothing more than ask Cambridge Analytica to delete the information they had collected. CA have defended themselves by saying that it clearly states what they will be able to access.

You can do something about this if you use FB!
