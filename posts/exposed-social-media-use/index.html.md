Howdy y'all Stephen H here, coming back at you with another blog post about how lit social media is. Today's blog post explains uses made of social media.

#### Communication

The main idea of social media is communication. Social media is a great way to communicate with others. Either around the world or even just sending that "good old meme," to your friend from across the classroom. Whatever it may be, social media is the perfect way to meet and have a wee chat with someone heh.

#### **Collaboration**

Social media is also good for collaboration. For example this blog is a collaboration with my team and I. Another collaborative app is Glow. Glow is used by schools for pupils to access documents from teachers or other pupils from home for using during snow days. BUT lets be honest who checks what they have to do for their Maths teacher when you could be out sledging?

#### Promotion

Social media could also be used for exposure to your business to gain new clients of all different age groups. For example shops like Topshop, Pretty Little Thing and Primark use social media such as Instagram and Snapchat to promote their products online to customers. Smaller businesses could also give away brand deals to social media influencers for example Youtubers who have to speak for what feels like forever about a product which is their, "holy grail."

#### Informing the public

Instead of turning on your TV and listening to the news reporter drone on about the, "cutest puppy to live," there is luckily a news app which notifies you when URGENT news stories are published. News stations like the BBC and ITV use this method to notify users. It takes less time as you can choose which article you want to read instead of watching TV for a good 10 minutes before they report something you are actually interested.
