### How social media companies can improve privacy

As we can tell from recent events, social media companies don't take our <a href="https://smlit.ml/social-media-personal-data-abuse/">privacy</a> all to <a href="https://smlit.ml/current-events-facebook-data-mining/">seriously</a>!
<h2>Minimising Data</h2>
These companies can store less data about their users, because if they collect less, there is a lot less of it to secure. If they simply don't have it then it can't be hacked, because it isn't there. Even if it is private, how private is it really? It is still stored there, ready to be stolen. Information which they don't really need to store includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Birthdays</li>
 	<li>Addresses</li>
 	<li>Jobs</li>
 	<li>Education</li>
</ul>
Unless they are running a site like LinkedIn where jobs and education are two of the main things that it is based around. Why does Facebook need to know where you live, it doesn't!

You don't have to keep this on your profile, so don't!
<h2>Securing What Developers Can Access</h2>
Facebook have been known to give access to API's such as find anyone by mobile, where you could guess a mobile number and find a full profile through this service. This shouldn't be so easy to do, like there was no hacking or anything, just using a service that Facebook hosted and provided to anyone. They should make sure developers only use their services for good. They have also been able to access data of friends without their permission, which surely is a breach of privacy as the friends don't have a choice to turn this off. So you can be as careful as you want, but if not all your friends are, then your efforts are for nothing, really. Make sure your friends.
<h2>Changing Privacy Settings</h2>
Although they can be hard to find, there are privacy settings which can stop most people from viewing stuff you don't want them to. This includes posts, birthdays and other profile information and you can also disable advertiser tracking on the website. Social media companies should make these settings part of the signup process and make them easier to access.
<h2>Friends</h2>
Even if you set your privacy very well, if people are on your friends list, they will be able to see more, so make sure that only your true friends/people you want can see it and not everyone. If you have random people on your friends, then there isn't really much point to securing it then if you don't know them.
