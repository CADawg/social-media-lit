All popular social media is owned by corporations, companies with hundreds of employees and makes thousands of pounds a day. These corporations include, but are not limited to:

*   Facebook, Inc.
*   Twitter
*   Alphabet, Inc.
*   Snap Inc.
*   LinkedIn

These companies usually provide their service for free. But wait, how can they do it for FREE? There is no such thing as a free lunch. They usually use advertising to pay for your use of the service, allowing advertisers to track you and market to you, in return for a fee. This is how they make their money. Now, usually a profile is worth about $5/month, so to pay for their site, they need to make sure they have a good user base. The more users they can get, the more money they can make.

### Companies buying others:

Some of the bigger social media corporations have bought out other smaller companies, using their profits, in an attempt to make some more money. These include:

*   Google buying Youtube in November 2006, for $1.35 Billion, they have now managed to turn it into a very profitable business.
*   Facebook acquiring WhatsApp for a cool $19 Billion, so that they can track their users (and non-facebook users) around the web more, allowing them to sell more data to advertisers.
*   Facebook also snatched up Instagram for just $1 Billion, again mainly for the same reasons as WhatsApp, and also so they can earn from the advertisements on Instagram.
This might not sound too bad, but it could mean that one day, one company could be the only option for social media and that usually doesn't end well, as they can push whatever they want upon their users, with no alternative, forcing them to stay with the company.
