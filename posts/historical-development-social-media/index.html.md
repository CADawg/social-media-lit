### Social Media before the 1990's

&nbsp;

Skip to a few decades ago even centuries ago the best ways of communicating with people were to send letters through the post. You'd have to leave your house to post a letter which could take a week to be delivered then another week just for the response. Whereas a Facebook status takes 2 minutes to be viewed by all your friends.

&nbsp;

The telegraph was invented in 1792. This allowed messages to be delivered way faster than a horse and its rider carries them. Although these type of messages had to be short and snappy. So, this was a revolutionary way of sending messages to others.

&nbsp;

Two important inventions were made in the late 1800's, the telephone made in 1890 by Alexander Graham Bell and the radio made the year after in 1891 by Guglielmo Marconi. Both these technologies are commonly used today.

### Social Media in the 20th Century

&nbsp;

In the 20<sup>th</sup> century technology changed very quickly, from the first ever supercomputers invented in 1940's to very early forms of the internet in the 60's.  In the 70's networks improved and users on Usenet could communicate through a virtual newsletter. By the 80's the use of computers at home were far more common and the normal and social media was becoming far more sophisticated. By the end of the 80's going into the 90's chat rooms were becoming more and more popular with users.

&nbsp;

### Social Media Today

&nbsp;

In today's world, social media has become a huge part of our day to day lives. We now use it to post videos or photos of what we are doing. We can also tweet about what we could have had for breakfast that morning. So, we can only guess that it is still going to improve and advance in the future.
