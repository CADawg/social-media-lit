There are many platforms of social media that dominate the scene right now.  Over the past few years social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat have appeared and completely taken over many peoples lives. This is so different to even social media 15 years ago where there were only a few platforms.  People could only access through computers, as the development of smartphones was not how it is now.

Social media platforms are split into 5 categories. These determine what is shared how it is used and can interest different business depending on what they are trying to sell.

### **Social Networking Sites**

The main goal of a social network site is to encourage users to network with each other. Connect, communicate and share. Often there are multiple ways of using a social network site. These include uploading pictures, updating statuses and comment on what you see. Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter come under this umbrella.

People engage on these platforms and share their thoughts. Facebook has an impressive 1.2 billion daily active users. Facebook can appeal to many demographics, all ages, races and genders. Twitter is most popular with the younger generations giving bite-size updates of the world with unique humour makes it perfect for teens and young adults. These platforms may be so popular among such a wide range because they are so customisable. You as the user control who you see what you watch and even what ads aimed at you. This makes the whole experience feel more personal and engaging.

### **Image sharing and Messaging Sites**

A generation of visual people has driven the uprising of social media just for image sharing and visual engagement. Image-sharing platforms like Instagram and visual messaging apps like Snapchat exploded in popularity in recent years.

> In fact, Instagram is on a fast-track toward one billion users as Snapchat's recent IPO has dominated the tech world in 2017.

Snapchat's unique self-destructing way of communication has been a massive hit with the younger generation. It is extremely useful and different way or marketing an event or brand, with many brands paying to have their own filters which subliminally influences the young audience. Others such as Pinterest and Instagram appeal to the most visual people. People, not just big brands making this their full-time career creating beautiful and refreshing feeds that and persuade and influence their following.

### **Video Sharing Websites**

One of the biggest video sharing websites is YouTube boasting well over one billion users a day. So, video is one of the easiest social platforms to engage in. There is no scrolling and reading. YouTube is a vastly populated with videos on everything you could ever be interested in, from 40-minute videos of people's whole washing machine cycles to YouTube tutorials by dramatic men. So, really, there is something for everyone. For many YouTube can be seen as an easy way to make money but it takes time patience and skill to make it and needs up to date business skills.

### **Social Blogging  **

Many believe that traditional blogging has gone to the age of the dinosaur. Due to this, they think that its much easier to just follow people on Instagram. This may be partially true, however, bloggers especially in the beauty community are alive and thriving making money from sponsored posts. Also, They often run other media platforms aside from this to help keep their brand alive. Many bloggers can be frustrating to their viewers. Often becoming desperate for more money and shoving brand deals and promotional codes down fans throats with the infamous #ad.

### **Social Community and Discussion Sites**

Often referred to as the dark corner of the internet. Discussion sites are where the stranger breeds of people come out in force. So, what was supposed to be a useful resource for innocent and concerned mums to ask about their child's behaviour it has become a breeding ground for memes, trolls and just straight up weird responses. For example, yahoo answers is a forming platform where you can ask anything you like. knowing the human race it is all too easy to fall into the dark hole and find some threads you will never UN-see.
