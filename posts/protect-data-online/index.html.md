# How to Protect your Data Online

Howdy y'all! Stephen H here. Coming back at you with another blog post about how lit social media is!

&nbsp;

Today's topic is on how you can protect yourself whilst surfing the web. The internet can be a great way to interact with others and make new friends however there can be some negatives to using the internet.

### Negatives of Using the Internet

These negatives could include identity theft, people using awareness of your activities and movements to act against you and employers using the information to exploit you, these are all common threats that could happen to someone like you if you don't protect yourself properly online.

### Ways to Protect yourself

Ways to protect your private information online is very simple. This includes keeping your hip and quirky Instagram account on private which is full of pictures of your pet dog and a video of your sister jumping out her window because she 'did it for the vine,' or even making your password secure by using 8 characters full of numbers and symbols instead of that usual Pet name and the number 1.

&nbsp;

For example this is what I use

&nbsp;

Username: Stephen2322

Password: Spot1

&nbsp;

Oh, well I guess I better change my password...

&nbsp;

Or you could just not have any social media at all! But then again how are we going to get our daily uploads of what lip shade Kylie Jenner is wearing or showing everyone that giant chocolate cake you just ate and how stressful it was buying it? Because if you didn't Instagram something did it really happen?

&nbsp;

Other ways to ensure your privacy is maintained includes making sure your anti-virus software is up to date and is working swiftly because you don't want them annoying, 'OPEN TO WIN AN IPHONEX!' texts popping up on your computer or phone every two minutes.

&nbsp;

Really good un-paid anti-virus software's are Avast and Malware Bytes if you want to save your dosh to buy the brand new IPHONE X! There is even paid versions if you want to splash out just to be sure.

&nbsp;

That's all you may need to know about protecting your private information online!
