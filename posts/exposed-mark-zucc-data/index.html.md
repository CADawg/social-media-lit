WAYOHH! Stephen H here, back with another blog post. I'm now ready to tell you how corporations such as Facebook steal and sell your data and how Mr. Zucc gets away with it.

<!--more-->

Recently in the news, Mark the owner of Facebook was caught out selling its users personal data to rig votes and who knows what else. We have a [full blog post about this written by Conor. ](https://smlit.ml/current-events-facebook-data-mining/)

But I'm gonna tell you how people like Mr Zucc do it.

#### Stealing Data

When you sign up for sites like Instagram and Facebook you are asked to fill out a form asking for your name, email, phone number.If you can name, it they want it. So when you're happily filling out these forms without a care in the world. You are actually giving them the right to know almost everything about you. When you like a post on Facebook, Mr. Zucc and his company will start to only show you related posts. For example my cousin shares a meme about a cat, two hours later my whole feed is stupid cats. Even if you are off your phone just chatting away to your mum about how you need new toothpaste your phone will listen and on your social media's you will start seeing ads about toothpaste popping up left, right and centre but you didn't hear that from me.

&nbsp;

Stealing data is becoming more and more in trend with business men such as Mr Zucc. Having technology so accessible by us normies its almost impossible not to have a storage of digital information.

#### More About The Zucc:

People are worried about third party apps stealing data, but maybe they aren't the main culprit, Facebook enable them to do it, and, in fact, Facebook do it too, they sell your data to advertisers, usually for ~$7 per user per month, showing how it would be easy to become so rich by running such a company.

Hopefully we will soon realise that there are better ways to use social media without giving up our privacy, because at the moment it seems that we are all rather willing to do so, even Mr. Zucc has a Facebook page, but do you think he would allow advertisers to see his info. I suspect not, I can guess that he may even run something such as ADBlock or UBlock Origin on his browser to stop it, and if you wouldn't be happy to have it done to yourself, should you really do it to others? Some people have criticised the way they make money, and rightly so!
